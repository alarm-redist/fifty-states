# 2020 New York Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In New York, districts must:

1. be contiguous
1. have equal populations
1. be geographically compact
1. preserve county and municipality boundaries as much as possible


### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of X.X%.

## Data Sources
Data for New York comes from the ALARM Project's [2020 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for New York.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
