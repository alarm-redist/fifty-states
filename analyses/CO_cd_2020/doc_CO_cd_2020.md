# 2020 Colorado Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Colorado, districts must:

1. be contiguous
1. have equal populations -- Section 44.3 1(a)
1. be geographically compact  -- Section 44.3 2(b)
1. preserve county and municipality boundaries as much as possible -- Section 44.3 2(a)
1. preserve whole communities of interest -- Section 44.3 2(a)
1. maximize the number of politically competitive districts -- Section 44.3 3(a)
1. not be drawn protect incumbents


### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources

We sample 5,000 districting plans for Colorado.
A partisan competitiveness constraint was used.
