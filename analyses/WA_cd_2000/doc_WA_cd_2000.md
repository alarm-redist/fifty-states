# 2000 Washington Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Washington, districts must:

1. be contiguous
1. have equal populations
1. be geographically compact
1. preserve county and municipality boundaries as much as possible
1. provide fair and effective representation and encourage electoral competition
1. not be drawn to favor or discriminate against a political party or group

The above information is largely sourced from the [Washington State Redistricting Commission's Report in 2000](https://app.leg.wa.gov/oralhistory/redistricting2/2000-beyond/2000-Excerpt_from_WA_State_Redistricting_Commission-7a-2.pdf).

### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.05%.

## Data Sources
Data for Washington comes from the ALARM Project's [ALARM Project's update](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZV5KF3) to [The Record of American Democracy](https://road.hmdc.harvard.edu/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for Washington.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
