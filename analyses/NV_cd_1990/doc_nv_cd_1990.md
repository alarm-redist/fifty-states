### 1990 Nevada Congressional Districts Redistricting requirements

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Nevada, according to [NCSL Redistricting Law 2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20041216185957/https://www.senate.mn/departments/scr/redist/red2000/Tab5appx.htm), districts must:

1.  be contiguous
2.  have equal populations

#### Algorithmic Constraints

We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

#### Data Sources

Data for Nevada comes from the [ALARM Project's update](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/loginpage.xhtml?redirectPage=%2Fdataset.xhtml%3FpersistentId%3Ddoi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FZV5KF3) to [The Record of American Democracy](https://road.hmdc.harvard.edu/).

Pre-processing Notes No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

Simulation Notes We sample 5,000 districting plans for Nevada. No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
