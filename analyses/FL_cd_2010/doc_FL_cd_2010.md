# 2010 Florida Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Florida, per Art. III, sec. 20 of the [state constitution](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3#A3S16), districts must:

1. may not favor or disfavor political parties or incumbents 
2. may not be drawn with the intent or result of denying or diluting minority representation 
3. must be contiguous 
4. must be compact 
5. must be equal in population as practicable 
6. and, must utilize, where feasible, existing political and geographical boundaries.

### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of X.X%.

## Data Sources
Data for Florida comes from the ALARM Project's [2020 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for Florida.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
