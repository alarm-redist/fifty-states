# 2010 Oklahoma Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Oklahoma, [districts must](https://web.archive.org/web/20120910205322/http://www.okhouse.gov/Research/2010LegislativeGuidetoRedistricting.pdf):

1. be contiguous
1. have equal populations


### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for Oklahoma comes from the ALARM Project's [All About Redistricting](https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/oklahoma/?cycle=2010&level=Congress&startdate=2011-05-10) and the ALARM Project's [Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.org/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).


## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 10,000 districting plans for Oklahoma via two independent runs of 5,000 each.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
