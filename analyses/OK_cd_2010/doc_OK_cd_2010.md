# 2010 Oklahoma Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Oklahoma, [districts must](https://web.archive.org/web/20120910205322/http://www.okhouse.gov/Research/2010LegislativeGuidetoRedistricting.pdf):

1. be contiguous
1. have equal populations


### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for Oklahoma comes from the ALARM Project's [All About Redistricting](https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/oklahoma/?cycle=2010&level=Congress&startdate=2011-05-10) and the ALARM Project's [Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.org/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).


## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 10,000 districting plans for Oklahoma via two independent runs of 5,000 each.
To balance county and municipality splits, we create pseudocounties for use in the county constraint, which leads to fewer municipality splits than using a county constraint.
