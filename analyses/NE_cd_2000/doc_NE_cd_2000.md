# 2000 Nebraska Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In ``Nebraska `, there are no state law requirements for congressional districts.

### Interpretation of requirements
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for ``Nebraska`` comes from the [ALARM Project's update](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZV5KF3) to [The Record of American Democracy](https://road.hmdc.harvard.edu/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 10,000 districting plans for ``Nebraska`` across 5 independent runs of the SMC algorithm.
We then thinned the number of samples to 5,000. 
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
