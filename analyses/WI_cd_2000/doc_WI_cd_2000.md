# 2000 Wisconsin Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In ``Wisconsin``, according to [NCSL Redistricting Law 2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20041216185957/https://www.senate.mn/departments/scr/redist/red2000/Tab5appx.htm), districts must:

1. be contiguous
1. have equal populations
1. be geographically compact
1. preserve county and municipality boundaries as much as possible
1. avoid diluting voting power of minorities in violation of the Voting Rights Act
1. avoid consideration for the residences of current legislators


### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for ``Wisconsin`` comes from the [ALARM Project's update](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZV5KF3) to [The Record of American Democracy](https://road.hmdc.harvard.edu/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for Wisconsin.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
