# 2000 Oklahoma Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In ``Oklahoma `, there are no state law requirements for congressional districts.

### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for ``Oklahoma`` comes from the [ALARM Project's update](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZV5KF3) to [The Record of American Democracy](https://road.hmdc.harvard.edu/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 10,000 districting plans for ``Oklahoma`` across 5 independent runs of the SMC algorithm.
We then thinned the number of samples to 5,000. 
To balance county and municipality splits, we create pseudocounties for use in the county constraint, which leads to fewer municipality splits than using a county constraint.
