# 2020 Texas State Senate Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Texas, according to [NCSL Redistricting Law 2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20041216185957/https://www.senate.mn/departments/scr/redist/red2000/Tab5appx.htm), districts must:

1. be contiguous
1. have equal populations
1. be geographically compact
1. preserve county and municipality boundaries as much as possible

### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 5.0%.

## Data Sources
Data for Texas comes from the [ALARM Project's update](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZV5KF3) to [The Record of American Democracy](https://road.hmdc.harvard.edu/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 10,000 districting plans for Texas across 5 independent runs of the SMC algorithm.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
