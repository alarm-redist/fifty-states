# 2000 Tennessee Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Tennessee, according to [NCSL Redistricting Law 2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20041216185957/https://www.senate.mn/departments/scr/redist/red2000/Tab5appx.htm), districts must:

1. be contiguous
1. have equal populations
1. be geographically compact
1. preserve county and municipality boundaries as much as possible


### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.05%.

## Data Sources
Data for Tennessee comes from the ALARM Project's [2020 Redistricting Data Files](https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-08-10-census-2020/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for Tennessee.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
