# 2000 Nevada Congressional Districts

## Redistricting requirements
In Nevada, districts must:

1. be contiguous
1. have equal populations
1. be geographically compact
1. preserve county and municipality boundaries as much as possible


### Algorithmic Constraints
We enforce a maximum population deviation of 0.5%.

## Data Sources
Data for Nevada comes from the [ALARM Project's update](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZV5KF3) to [The Record of American Democracy](https://road.hmdc.harvard.edu/).

## Pre-processing Notes
No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes
We sample 5,000 districting plans for Nevada.
No special techniques were needed to produce the sample.
